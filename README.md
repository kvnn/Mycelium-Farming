# Growing Mycelium

## Sanitization
>  Use 70% alcohol or 1:10 bottle strength bleach and water ... 70% alcohol is better than 90%+...

## Monotub method
A. Innoculation
0. always use highest sterilization measure possible, but especially for innoculation
1. use the "PF Tek" method to innoculate Mycelium into a our Substrate (see below for making Substrate)
2. after cooked, inject Mycelium into jars
3. after innoculated, leave jars in a loose cardboard box for 4-6 weeks

B. Growing the Colonization
// IN PROGRESS
0. always use highest sterilization measure possible
1. prepare a Monotub with ~4 inches of sterlized Substrate
2. wait until Mycelium has strongly colonized the jar
4. mix Mycelium from jar into Monotub Substrate
5. seal and store the Monotub. ensure there is enough humidity (TODO: what percentage? I currently believe ~90% is good)

## Easy Method to Make Bulk Substrate (Coco Coir + Vermiculite)

by [Cameron Ruggles via Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwuTe43droY&t=290s)

Per 5 liters of water:
- 500 grams Coco coir
- 2 liters fine vermiculite 
- 1 cup of gypsum from Plaster of Paris 

Mix all together, let sit for at least an hour and then mix. Let sit to hydrate and cool for approximately 24 hours. Ideally keep insulated to aid the pasteurization process.

Once room temp, double check to make sure it is at field capacity and mix in your colonized grain spawn. 

You can get vermiculite and coco coir at most garden stores. You can find gypsum at most big box stores like walmart, often found in the painting section. They also have cheap 5 gallon buckets for a few bucks. 

Home depot and Lowes are great places to go to find all the items.


## Ethnomycology
Beauveria Bassiana might be successful in killing cockroaches / ants.
