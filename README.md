Per 5 gallons of water:
- 500 grams Coco coir
- 2 liters fine vermiculite 
- 1 cup of gypsum from Plaster of Paris 

Mix all together, let sit for at least an hour and then mix. Let sit to hydrate and cool for approximately 24 hours. Ideally keep insulated to aid the pasteurization process.

Once room temp, double check to make sure it is at field capacity and mix in your colonized grain spawn. 

You can get vermiculite and coco coir at most garden stores. You can find gypsum at most big box stores like walmart, often found in the painting section. They also have cheap 5 gallon buckets for a few bucks. 

Home depot and Lowes are great places to go to find all the items.
